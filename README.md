# tensorflow-scripts (WIP)
This repository contains Tensorflow Programs to perform Label Extraction using the ImageNet Library
Follow instructions here to install the required libraries:

## Tensorflow : 
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/get_started/os_setup.html 
The recommended way is to do pip install. If you already have an old installed version of tensorflow or protobuf, please do a clean uninstall and install the latest 0.10.x version. Older versions seem to have compatibility issues with the ImageNet Library. After installation, please run the "hello-world" example to check if tensorflow is imported properly.
